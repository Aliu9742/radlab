## V3_useful_funcs
This is a python module I created containing functions that I used often for my thesis project. It also contains the Atom class that's meant for reading crd, pdb, and gro files easier. An instance of the atom object can be initialized with a line from a crd, pdb, or gro file containing information about an atom. The attributes of the Atom object are the columns of these files, and the methods of the Atom object allows users to format its attributes in any of the three chemical file formats.
